The grand plan for this tutorial is to learn how to serialize/deserialize any object efficiently in time and space, so you could focus on other, more interesting things.

This tutorial will cover these main topics:
* `Hello World` write one control flow for both: serialization and deserialization.
* `Composer` efficiently compose complex serialization flows.
* `Squeeze Me!` compress your data when you know what it stores.
* `Anything is Possible` extend library for custom container, compress geometry and more.
* `Little or Big` change endianness if you want best performance on PowerPC.
