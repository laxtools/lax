# db use case

 - single query 
   - stored procedure query only
   - direct execution not allowed
   
 - multiple queries 
   - item operations require to have multiple queries
   - a typical example is item crafting
   - item_craft_transaction
      - begin transaction
      - query1 : remove a item 
      - query2 : remove a item 
      - query3 : insert a item 
      - commit 

 - chaining queries
   - example - load character info: 
     - load stat
     - load inven
     - load friends
     - load ....
     - completed
     - each operation requires to work with application code. 
     - when one of the operations fails, then the flow fails. 

# requirements

 - requires something that contains queries
 - requires something must be a message
   - to reuse task / task_scheduler for db operations.
 
 idea:
 - tx : message

 - stx : tx
   - requested transaction to db
   - has queries inside
   - has a next tx to run 
   - cps(continuation passing) somehow

 - rtx : tx
   - has sx context
   - has error description
   - has chained tx


# login

 q_login : query : message
 {
   req : query::req {
   }

   res : query::res {
   }
 } 

 query_scheduler::get().schedule( q_login, channel );

 tx로 만들어서 추가

 완료 후 channel로 통지.
 
 channel::find("login").sub( q_login::topic, on_db_login_resp );

 on_db_login_resp( query::ref_t query)

 // cast and process
