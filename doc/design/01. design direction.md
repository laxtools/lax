# Simplest and fastest networking code. 


 - asio or whatever 
 - fastest buffering / sending 
 - simplest protocol handling / dispatching 

more like 0mq.

communication completed separated from processing.

// no id based access. only through a pointer

// timeout 처리 등은 상위 프로토콜이 처리할 문제  

// timer, timeout

// runnable
// - schedule_policy::group

runner->create( policy );
runner->attach( runnable ); 
runner->detach( runnable );
runner->destroy();

// sink 

sink->attach( channel, [filter function] ); 
sink->detach( channel );

forward all messages from channel to sink using a filter function if exists.
default filter is to foward all messages to the sink. 


// debug 

const char* get_desc() const for timer, pipe, channel, sink, and runnable. 
log() functions for each base class with get_desc() and line/function information. 

# Use case

## instance based server. 

 Servers: 

  - login

  - match_maker 
    - keeps match requests 
	- matches with the requests

  - lobby
    - get connections from clients 
	- manage game instances. 

  - client 
    - connects to one of the lobbies. 
	- changes connection to the lobby with the instance created. 

### Lobby 

 Actors: 
  - lobby
    - user
  - instance_manager 
    - instance 
      - player

 Refs: 
   - lobby 
      - match maker

### Match Maker 

 Actors: 
  - match_maker (s) 
  - match_dispatcher (function?) 
   
 Refs: 
   - match_maker 
     - instance_managers
 
### Database 

 DBs: 
   - auth db
     - auth key (timed) 
 
   - game db 
     - sharding

 Database runner 

  - db / connection / query 
  - nanodbc 
    - odbc wrapper
  - validation
    - reconnection on request 
  - detailed statistics / logging 

### Failure Analysis 

 Points:

  - DB 
    - game db 
	  - disaster. wait till it recovers. 

    - auth db 
	  - new login, change connection is not possible. 
	  - new games cannot be started.

  - match maker
    - new match making is not possible. 
    - after recovery, it can be started. 

  - lobby 
    - current games, users on the lobby will be disconnected from service. 
	- fresh start from login is required. 


 No SPOF. Mostly waiting recovery can be done for all failures. 

 Fine. 

### Live maintenance. 

 Lobby with wait-stop functionality.

 Match maker with a replacement functionality. 

 DB not possible. 

#### wait-stop 

 login server is added to provide a list of available lobbies. 

 while in wait-stop, no more users can join the lobby. 
 when a game ends, users will be moved to another lobby. 
 when all users are moved, wait-stop is finished and the lobby will be finished. 


#### replacement 

 When a match maker enters replacement, a new match maker is added. 
 Then all new match making requested are forwared to the new match maker. 
 When the match maker does not have any match request, then the match maker stops.
